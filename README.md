Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification with Data Augmentation

This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, leveraging state-of-the-art architectures and techniques such as data augmentation, data visualization, and transfer learning. The goal is to build a robust image classifier capable of handling slight perturbations in the input data, enhancing the model's performance and generalization capability. Pre-trained models are utilized to achieve high accuracy with minimal training time.

Features:
Implemented CNNs for image classification.
Employed Data Visualization Techniques to gauge the effectiveness of training
Employed data augmentation to increase dataset size and robustness.
Integrated batch normalization for regularization.
Used transfer learning to achieve high accuracy with fewer training epochs.

Results:
The CNN achieves high accuracy on the image classification task, demonstrating robustness to data perturbations due to data augmentation and transfer learning.
